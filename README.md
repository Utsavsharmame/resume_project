# Personal Portfolio Website (Week 1)

## Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built using pure HTML5. It showcases my background, skills, and contact information. The goal of this week was to establish a strong semantic foundation without using any CSS styling.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Navigation**: Internal links to jump between About, Skills, and Contact sections.
- **Contact Form**: A functional form structure with validation attributes (`required`, `type="email"`).
- **Multimedia**: Includes an image placeholder for the profile picture.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main file containing the website structure and content.
- `images/`: Directory for storing image assets.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Clone specific repository or download the folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  To edit, open the folder in VS Code.

## HTML Concepts Used
- **Document Structure**: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`.
- **Text Formatting**: `<h1>` to `<h3>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs.
- **Lists**: `<ul>` and `<li>` for listing skills.
- **Links**: `<a>` tags for navigation and external links.
- **Forms**: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<label>` for user interaction.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `class`, `href`, `src`, `alt`, `required`.
